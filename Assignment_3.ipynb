    "1.What are the benefits of including roles in the programmes? \n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "we try to create roles in programme by creating module or simpily by writing a code in modular style.Modular programming is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality.A module interface expresses the elements that are provided and required by the module. The elements defined in the interface are detectable by other modules. The implementation contains the working code that corresponds to the elements declared in the interface. Modular programming is closely related to structured programming and object-oriented programming, all having the same goal of facilitating construction of large software programs and systems by decomposition into smaller pieces."

This means that a global variable can be accessed inside or outside of the function.There’s only one global Python scope per program execution. This scope remains in existence until the program terminates and all its names are forgotten. Otherwise, the next time you were to run the program, the names would remember their values from the previous run.\n",

Every time we call a function, we are also creating a new local scope. On the other hand, we can think of each def statement and lambda expression as a blueprint for new local scopes. These local scopes will come into existence whenever we call the function at hand.By default, parameters and names that  assign inside a function exist only within the function or local scope associated with the function call. When the function returns, the local scope is destroyed and the names are forgotten.example is given below:-"
