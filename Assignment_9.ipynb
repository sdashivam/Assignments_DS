    "6. What are the three “mode” arguments that can be passed to the open() function?\n",
    "Ans:-the mode argument in open function is given below:-\n",
    "'r'       open for reading (default)\n",
    "'w'       open for writing, truncating the file first\n",
    "'x'       create a new file and open it for writing\n",
    "'a'       open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists\n",
    "'b'       binary mode\n",
    "'t'       text mode (default)\n",
    "'+'       open a disk file for updating (reading and writing)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What happens if an existing file is opened in write mode?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "To open a file in write mode, “w” is specified. When mode “w” is specified, it creates an empty file for output operations. OR, If a file with the same name already exists, its contents are truncated and over-written. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file. Creates the file if the file does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How do you tell the difference between read() and readlines()?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "read() --The read() method returns the specified number of bytes from the file. Default is -1 which means the whole file.\n",
    "readlines() -- readlines() function is to read all the contents from the given file and save the output in a list.The readlines() function reads until the End of the file, making use of readline() function internally and returns a list with all the lines read from the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What data structure does a shelf value resemble?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "A shelf value resembles a dictionary value; it has keys and values, along with keys() and values() methods that work similarly to the dictionary methods of the same names."
