    "Ans:- Excel spreadsheets and CSV spreadsheets they both have there own merit and demerits in terms of operations. and we use both of them for data science projects. their advantages are given below:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Excel ---\n",
    "1. Excel files can only be read by applications and not on any other systems, application or data platform.\n",
    "2. Excel consumes more memory than CSV.\n",
    "3. Excel is generally larger, slower and more complicated when compared to CSV.\n",
    "4. Files saved in Excel format cannot be edited by text editors and also Excel file can be password protected.\n",
    "5. Excel can perform VBA Coding, functions, formulas and create summaries easily when compared to CSV.\n",
    "6. Reading large data set is much easier for the end-user to read, comprehend and understand when compared to CSV.\n",
    "7. Excel can be opened with Microsoft office only and does not support any other platform when compared to CSV.\n",
    "8. Excel also provides the user option for external linking of data from other sources and also the user can do custom add-ins.\n",

    "CSV --\n",
    "1. CSV file does not need any specific platform to open it can also be opened in a simple text editor and the user can simply read and understand it.\n",

If csvfile is a file object, it should be opened with newline=''.\n",
